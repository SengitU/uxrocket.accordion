I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Ye-ha! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
